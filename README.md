# Library

This is a library project to show books that the user can create themselves. 

This was the first time in a little while using Javascript! It was a great refresher even though I had to go back and replace sections of code every now and then.

I'm starting to get the hang of combining HTML, CSS, and JS neatly into these smaller projects. Looking forward to the next JS design pattern.
